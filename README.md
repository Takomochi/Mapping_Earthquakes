# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of the project
This project is to create an earthquake map. I have created a map that utilizes three data with three different styles.<br>
These are the main tasks: 
  1. Add Tectonic Plate Data
  2. Add Major Earthquake Data
  3. Add an Additional Map

## Resources
- Data: [Tectonic Plates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json), [Earthquakes for the past 7 days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson),  [Major earthquakes for the past 7 days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)
- Software/ Library: Visual studio code, Leaflet

## Results
